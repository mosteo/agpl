   --  The general URL form as described in RFC2616 is:
   --
   --  http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
   --
   --  Note also that there are different RFC describing URL like the 2616 and
   --  1738 but they use different terminologies. Here we try to follow the
   --  names used in RFC2616 but we have implemented some extensions at the
   --  end of this package. For example the way Path and File are separated or
   --  the handling of user/password which is explicitly not allowed in the
   --  RFC but are used and supported in many browsers. Here are the extended
   --  URL supported:
   --
   --  http://username:password@www.here.com:80/dir1/dir2/xyz.html?p=8&x=doh
   --   |                            |       | |          |       |
