--  A bag is a container for unordered objects.
--  Its interesting properties are:
--  O (1) access to any position (though you can't know what's in that position,
--   but this can be useful in randomized algorithms).
--  O (1) insertion and deletion of objects in the bag.
--  Direct access to the array of objects
--   (Take care of using the Last function and not the 'Last attribute)
